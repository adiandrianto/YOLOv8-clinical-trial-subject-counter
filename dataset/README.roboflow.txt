The dataset includes 560 images.
Person are annotated in YOLOv8 format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:

The following augmentation was applied to create 2 versions of each source image:
* Random rotation of between -15 and +15 degrees
* Random shear of between -20° to +20° horizontally and -20° to +20° vertically
* Random brigthness adjustment of between -25 and +25 percent
* Random Gaussian blur of between 0 and 2.5 pixels
